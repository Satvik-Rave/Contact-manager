# Contact Manager Backend
This is a NodeJs + ExpressJs-based backend system of a contact manager application that stores the contacts of the users under secure authorization. The database of this application is deployed over a cloud NoSQL database (MongoDB) which essentially uses AWS as its data store at the Mumbai servers.

## Steps to run
1. Download/clone the repo.
2. Install node modules.
3. Based on the configuration use the npm run dev command.
4. Use either Postman or Thunder Client (VS Code Extension) to send requests and get responses to verify the working of the backend.
